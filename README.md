# SQL Practice - Basic to Advanced Queries

I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed all the questions on [SQL Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/). To further solidify my understanding and track my progress, I have created this repository where I will add and continue to update MySQL queries, ranging from basic to advanced levels.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of MySQL queries that I have practiced and learned through various challenges. It will include solutions to problems involving:

- **Basic Queries:** Commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- **Intermediate Concepts:** Queries involving `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries.
- **Advanced Topics:** Optimized queries, window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and advanced data manipulation techniques.

## Why This Repository?

1. **Learning and Growth:** By documenting my progress, I aim to track my journey from mastering SQL basics to tackling more complex challenges.
2. **Knowledge Sharing:** This repository will also serve as a reference for others looking to learn SQL or solve similar problems.
3. **Practical Application:** As I apply SQL to real-world projects, I will update the repository with examples and optimized queries.

## Structure

The queries in this repository will be organized into categories, such as:

1. **Basic Queries**: Examples of foundational SQL operations.
2. **Intermediate Queries**: Solutions involving joins, aggregations, and filtering.
3. **Advanced Queries**: Complex problem-solving scenarios and optimizations.

## What's Next?

I plan to add advanced queries and solutions as I progress in learning MySQL and tackling more challenging scenarios. This journey reflects my commitment to continuous learning and improving my skills in data management and analytics.
